## EXERCISES 1.A

1. Suppose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, not both \\(0\\). Find real numbers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) such that
$$1/(a+bi)=c+di.$$
2. Show that $$-1+\sqrt{3i} \over 2.$$ is a cube root of \\(1\\) (meaning that its cube root equals \\(1\\)).
3. Find two distinct square roots of \\(i\\).
4. Show that \\(\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha\\) for all \\(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}.\\)
Testing out the Hugo.
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
